  title: You've upgraded Live Stream Notifier
  version: 3.0.0

 - Add new channels manager, which is the last piece to allow more channel providers
 - Three new styles for the panel
 - Offline channels are in a separate tab instead of below the live channels in the panel
 - Context menu for channels in the panel, allowing to refresh their individual state, open their archive page if they're live or open the channel's chat only
 - Channels and users are now saved in a database instead of a plaintext file
 - Nearly every line of code in the extension has been rewritten
 - A completely new website

**Note**: Channels are no longer removed if a user stops following them. I've thought a lot about this change with the new way the channels manager does things and this is the best solution I could come up with. If you have a better idea, feel free to contact me!
