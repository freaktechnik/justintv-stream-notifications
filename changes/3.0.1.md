  title: You've upgraded Live Stream Notifier
  version: 3.0.1
  permalink: /changes/3.0.1/
---
 - Add new channels manager, which is the last piece to allow more channel providers
 - Three new styles for the panel
 - An optional extra row of info for live channels in the panel, showing the number of viewers and the category of a stream
 - Offline channels are in a separate tab instead of below the live channels in the panel
 - Context menu for channels in the panel, allowing to refresh their individual state, open their archive page if they're live or open the channel's chat only
 - Channels and users are now saved in a database instead of a plaintext file
 - Nearly every line of code in the extension has been rewritten
 - A completely new website
 - Added support for Hitbox, Ustream, Livestream, MLG.tv, Azubu and YouTube ([as far as possible](/justintv-stream-notifications/providers/))
 - Show hosting twitch channels as live with the title and thumbnail of the hosted channel
 - Filter channels in the panel (and the channels manager)

***Note***: Channels are no longer removed if a user stops following them. I've thought a lot about this change with the new way the channels manager does things and this is the best solution I could come up with. If you have a better idea, feel free to contact me!
