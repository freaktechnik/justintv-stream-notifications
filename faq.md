I've just encountered a bug!
----------------------------
 1. Go to <a href="http://github.com/freaktechnik/justintv-stream-notifications/issues">the GitHub Issues page</a> and report the issue.
 2. Disable and reenable the Add-on. This should fix it in most cases.

It doesn't display my favorite channels when they are online!
-------------------------------------------------------------
You probably haven't added any channels to the channels manager yet. To open it, click "Manage" in the panel or open it via the extension's settings.

How do I go to the extension's settings?
----------------------------------------
Open the Add-ons manager in Firefox. To open it, click on the menu button and then "Add-ons" or open a new tab and type `about:addons` in the URL-bar. Clicke the "Options" button in the row of this extension in Add-ons manager and you're done.

I can't find a setting for something important
----------------------------------------------
If you're lucky, there is an [about:config setting](/aboutconfig/) for it.
