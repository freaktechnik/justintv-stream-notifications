You will never miss your favorite streams ever again!

But now don't just close this page! It is here to help you getting started with the extension. If you don't want this extension to open any tab itself when the browser starts, be sure to uncheck the "Open a tab with update info after an update" setting.

Get started
-----------
First thing to do is adding the channels you'd like to get notified about.
The easiest way is by having your Twitch username saved in the Firefox password manager.
You don't have an account for twitch? No problem, you can also enter a list of channels the add-on should check in the channels manager.
To add the channels, open the channels manager either via the panel or the extension settings.
In the channels manager you can add channels directly, add all channels a user follows or automatically add all the followed channels of all users you've saved the credentials for in Firefox.

How do I go to the settings?
----------------------------
 - Open the Add-ons manager in Firefox. To open it, click on the menu button and then "Add-ons" or open a new tab and type `about:addons`.
 - In the add-ons manager you click on the "Options" button for "Stream Notifier".
 - That's it! You are now on the settings page!

This extension is missing a supercool feature!

I guess I've forgot to add it then. Remind me via [e-Mail](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}).
