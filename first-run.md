You will never miss your favorite streams ever again!

Let's get this out of the way: by using this extension you accept its [EULA](/justintv-stream-notifications/eula).

But now don't just close this page! It is here to help you getting started with the extension. If you don't want this extension to open any tab itself when the browser starts, be sure to uncheck the "Open a tab with update info after an update" setting.

Get started
-----------
First thing to do is adding the channels you'd like to get notified about.

<!-- The easiest way is to have the Add-on guess your favorite channels by looking at your logins, however this only works for a few of the available [providers](/justintv-stream-notifications/providers/) and still needs a click on a button in the channels manager. -->

Add the first channel to monitor from one of the supported [providers](/justintv-stream-notifications/providers/) in the channels manager.

You can open the channels manager via wrench button in the panel that pops up when you click on the extension icon in the toolbar above. You can quickly access all monitored channels from that panel, too.

When selecting <samp>User</samp> instead of <samp>Channel</samp>, all channels a user follows are added.

How do I go to the settings?
----------------------------
 - Right click on the extension icon in the toolbar above.
 - Select <samp>Manage Extension</samp>
 - That's it! You are now on the settings page!

Detailed Help
-------------
You can find detailed step-by-step guides for specific actions in the help section of this site.

You can always return to this site by going to the channels manager and clicking on the <samp>Help</samp> button.

This extension is missing a super cool feature!
