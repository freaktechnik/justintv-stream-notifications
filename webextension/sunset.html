        <h1>Stream Notifier is discontinued</h1>
        <p>This update for Stream Notifier makes the extension do nothing other than show this page. I've decided to stop maintaining this extension and in order to retire the API clients that means making it non-functional. You can read more about my decision in my <a href="https://humanoids.be/log/2021/02/sunsetting-stream-notifier" rel="noreferer" target="_blank">blogpost</a>. To uninstall the extension, you can simply click the button below.</p>
