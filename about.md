This extension is a spare-time project by [Martin Giger](http://humanoids.be).
A thank you to all translators and opportunal contributors.

# History
The extension initially started as "Qubetubers Notifier". It was dedicated to
notifying the user if a stream of the gaming community [Qubetubers](http://qubetubers.com)
went live. Back then the main channels were on livestream and there was a
channel on Twitch, which was just a gamer-based skin for Justin.tv, like YouTube
Gaming is these days.

I eventually decided to generalize the extension as version 2.0 to support any
Justin.tv or Twitch channel. That's where the short name "jtvn" and the
addons.mozilla.org URL come from. It was called "Justin.tv Stream Notifications".
The first version under that name got released on November 4th 2012.

The panel was added soon after and then I started to slowly generalize the
extension to support multiple providers.

Generalizing it for any provider needed a lot of work, but also made the
extension solider than ever. The initial version with support for other providers
than Twitch and Justin.tv was released as version 3.0.0 on May 16th 2015.

Sadly Justin.tv got shut down before 3.0.0 was finished and I had to pull that
code out. I also decided to do the rebranding to "Live Stream Notifier" and the
new icon already.

From there on all the providers now listed on the [Providers](/providers) page
were added. Some were already removed again, because they ceased to exist since.
Many other features started to come in, once 3.0.0 was finally finished.

For the big Firefox Quantum (57) release, all code had to be moved to the new
WebExtension format. Which was a feat that lasted almost a year, but brought
with itself some improvements like import and export as well as better redirect
visualization in the panel.
